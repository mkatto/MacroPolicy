<p>According to Keynsian Economics, there are three main ways a government can stabilize an economy during a recession. One way is to decrease interest rates. This allows easier borrowing for businesses and therefore creates more jobs. The second way a government can increase jobs is by decreasing taxes. This is based on the same idea that additional money in the hands of citizens will allow for more businesses to stay open. The third main way a government can stabilize a recession is by increasing spending to again put more money in the hands of citezens. </p>

<p> We can notice a couple of basic correlations on the prelininary heatmap. For example, we can see that obviously the more farming an economy has, the less service employees the country has. Then we will start to notice other things like the higher the  minimum wage, the more energy costs. We can see that the interest, taxes, and unemployment before the recession are corrolated to those variables during the recession. The corrolations to unemployment are:</p>

<p>Data was difficult to collect due o the fact that all nations have varying levels of data collection and are rarely consistant with other nations. We were initially going to hone in on the European Union, but their data collection wasn't as good as we had anticipated and didn't start being widely collected until after 2008. We then transitioned to finding data for the entire world. All of our data ended up coming from the world bank except for minimum wage which came from the International Labor Organization and occupation which came from the workld facctbook. For x-xariables, we use data that was available in 2007 for prediction purposes, but we use the change between 2010 and 2007 to identify best practices for governments after a recession has hit. The y-axis is unemployment from 2010. <br><b>agriculture:</b> Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)<br><b>services:</b> Employment in services (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)<br><b>industry:</b> Employment in industry (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)<br><b>minwage:</b> Minimum wage annaully by county in USD<br><b>pretax:</b> Taxes on income, profits and capital gains (% of total taxes) in 2007<br><b>posttax:</b> Taxes on income, profits and capital gains (% of total taxes) in 2010<br><b>tax:</b> The difference in taxes between 2010 and 2007 (posttax - pretax)<br><b>preunemployment:</b> Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate) in 2007<br><b>postunemployment:</b> Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate) in 2010<br><b>prerealinterest:</b> Real interest rate (%) in 2007<br><b>postrealinterest:</b> Real interest rate (%) in 2010<br><b>prespending:</b> General government final consumption expenditure (% of GDP) in 2007<br><b>postspending:</b> General government final consumption expenditure (% of GDP) in 2010<br><b>spending:</b> Difference in spending between 2010 and 2007 (postspending - prespending)<br><b>kWhcapita:</b> Electric power consumption (kWh per capita)<br><b>incomeshare:</b> Income share held by highest 10%</p>

<p>One major issue that our team had was that there is a very limited amount of consistant data for the countries. Of the features that we had, the maximum number of data points was 162 and the minimum was 80. This created a neccessity to make our model as simple as possible as including all potential features would limit our data to only 23 data points. To ensure we only kept only the most important variables, we created a function much like regsubsets in R except it accounted for potential blank data points for each combination as opposed to the whole dataset (Our function only seemed efficient enough to work on up to around 200 combinations).  </p>
